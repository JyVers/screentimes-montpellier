# ScreenTimes Montpellier

## 📖 Overview
This project was built to provide an easy-to-use interface for checking movie sessions in Montpellier's cinemas (Pathé Comédie, Pathé Odysseum, Diagonal Capitole, and Utopia). It features a clean design with a timeline view for sessions and a filterable list of films. The frontend is developed with React, and the backend (still in progress) will eventually integrate real-time data.

## 🔍 Current Status
- Frontend: Fully functional with test data.
- Backend: In development. Currently using static test data for movie sessions.
